# Multi-Modal-AI-Travel-Assistant
AI-powered travel assistant that speaks, translates, draws, and books flights

I built a multilingual, voice-powered travel assistant.

(Yes, it speaks, translates, draws... and even books your flights.)

👇 Here’s the breakdown for both techies and non-techies:

🧠 The *idea*: 
Make flight search more fun, natural, and human. 
→ Ask it for prices → it *talks back* 
→ Say “Book me a ticket” → it *confirms it* 
→ Want visuals? → it *draws your destination* 
→ Prefer French? → it *translates instantly*

💡 Why these tools? 
Think of each AI model as a specialist in your team:

→ **GPT-4** = the brain (handles chat + logic) 
→ **DALL·E** = the artist (generates visuals) 
→ **TTS (text-to-speech)** = the voice (responds in audio) 
→ **Google Gemini** = the translator (switches languages) 
→ **Gradio** = the stage (brings it all to life in a browser)

🛠️ Tech Stack: 
→ OpenAI APIs (GPT-4, DALL·E, TTS) 
→ Google Gemini 
→ Python + Gradio

🧰 But here’s the cool part — “TOOLS” in LLMs: 
They’re not physical tools. 
They're *functions* the model can call when it needs help. 
Think: “Let me check the price” → it uses `get_ticket_price()`. 
Or “Let me confirm that booking” → it calls `make_booking()`.

This is how GPT models go beyond text — they can *act*.

🚀 Why this matters: 
We're not just chatting with bots anymore. 
We're interacting with **assistants** that can reason, respond, draw, speak — even take actions.

All in one flow. One conversation. One screen.

If you had an AI assistant for your business — what would you want it to do?

And for my fellow builders: 
👉 What’s one way to improve response *latency* in multi-tool LLM apps?
(Asking for a dev friend 😉)
